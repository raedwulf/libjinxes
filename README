libjinxes
=========

This is a C99 terminal drawing library inspired by termbox.

Rationale
---------

The reason for the revival is termbox's use of waf as a build system and
the potential for something even more concise but full featured than termbox.

Features
-----------------

* Does not depend on the ncurses' terminfo database but has compile time
  configuration to be able to generate the required terminfo data from
  the terminfo database.

Planned Features
----------------

* Fallback to the terminfo database if the terminfo is not compiled in.
* Optimise the output from blitting by working out the shortest commands
  based on the terminal type.
